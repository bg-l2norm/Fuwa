Fuwa is a minimalistic, rich TUI (Terminal User Interface) buddy powered by LLMs. It acts as an emotional, slightly demanding terminal companion (an axolotl!) that observes your high-level file activities and blurts out motivation, challenges, or fun comments.

## Installation

To avoid dependency conflicts with other projects on your system (dependency hell), it is highly recommended to install Fuwa inside an isolated virtual environment.

1. Clone the repository.
2. Create and activate a Python virtual environment:
   ```bash
   # Create a virtual environment named 'venv'
   python3 -m venv venv

   # Activate the environment (Linux/macOS)
   source venv/bin/activate

   # Activate the environment (Windows)
   venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
3. Install the requirements into the isolated environment:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Configuration

On first run, Fuwa generates a `config.json` file in the root directory. You must configure it with your desired LLM provider and API key.

```json
{
    "watch_folders": [
        "."
    ],
    "provider": "openai",
    "model": "gpt-4o-mini",
    "api_key": "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE",
    "personality": "You are Fuwa, a cute, slightly sarcastic, and extremely motivating axolotl terminal companion..."
}
```

- **`watch_folders`**: An array of absolute or relative paths to directories you want Fuwa to observe.
- **`provider`**: E.g., `openai`, `anthropic`, `openrouter`.
- **`model`**: E.g., `gpt-4o-mini`, `claude-3-haiku-20240307`, `openrouter/auto`.

## Running Fuwa

Run the main application:
```bash
python fuwa.py
```

Fuwa will wake up, start observing your files, and interact with you!

## Testing

To run the test suite, ensure your virtual environment is activated, then use:
```bash
python -m pytest test_fuwa.py
```
